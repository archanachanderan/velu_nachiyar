      <p class="display2">Velu Nachiyar was not only a royal figurehead but a hands-on military leader who personally trained her troops. She emphasized guerrilla tactics, leveraging the difficult terrain of Tamil Nadu to outmaneuver the British forces. Her army was notable for its inclusion of women fighters and people from diverse social backgrounds, reflecting her vision of an inclusive resistance. She trained her soldiers in archery, sword fighting, and horseback riding, ensuring they were well-prepared for unconventional warfare. Velu was known for her sharp strategic mind and ability to inspire courage and loyalty among her followers. Her leadership style combined discipline with empathy, making her troops fiercely loyal and motivated. She also used intelligence networks to gather information about enemy movements, allowing her to plan surprise attacks and ambushes. This effective military leadership was crucial in her ability to reclaim Sivagangai and resist British advances. Velu Nachiyar’s role as a warrior queen challenged contemporary gender norms and paved the way for future women leaders in India’s freedom struggle.</p>
