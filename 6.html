      <h1 class="display">Reclamation of Sivagangai</h1>
      <p class="display2">In 1780, after years of careful planning, alliance-building, and training, Velu Nachiyar launched a successful campaign to reclaim her kingdom of Sivagangai from British control. Utilizing guerrilla warfare and leveraging local support, her forces attacked British positions, causing significant disruption. The capture of the British ammunition depot, led by Kuyili, was a turning point in the campaign, weakening British firepower and morale. Velu’s victory was remarkable as she became one of the first Indian queens to successfully challenge and defeat the British East India Company in battle. Her reclaiming of Sivagangai was not just a personal triumph but a powerful symbol of indigenous resistance to colonial rule. The success inspired other regional rulers and freedom fighters to oppose British expansion. Velu Nachiyar’s restoration to power demonstrated the effectiveness of local leadership combined with strategic alliances and unconventional tactics against a dominant colonial power.</p>
