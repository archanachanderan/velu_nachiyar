      <h1 class="display">Innovative Warfare Tactics</h1>
      <p class="display2">Velu Nachiyar’s military strategies were innovative and daring, especially given the era’s conventional warfare methods. She adopted guerrilla tactics, striking quickly and retreating before the British could regroup. One of her most famous military actions was the destruction of a British ammunition depot in 1780, which severely crippled the enemy’s firepower. This mission was carried out by Kuyili, her trusted commander, who executed a self-sacrificial act by setting herself on fire to destroy the depot. This act is considered one of the earliest instances of a suicide attack in Indian history. Velu Nachiyar’s willingness to use such bold tactics reflected her determination and strategic acumen. She also employed deception, intelligence, and surprise attacks to keep the British forces off balance. These tactics allowed her smaller, less-equipped army to successfully challenge the better-armed British troops. Her innovative warfare significantly contributed to her victory in reclaiming Sivagangai and stands as an early example of unconventional warfare in India.</p>
