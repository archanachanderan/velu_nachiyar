      <h1 class="display">Early Life and Royal Heritage</h1>
      <p class="display2">Velu Nachiyar was born on January 3, 1730, into the royal Sethupathi family of Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu. As the only daughter of Raja Chellamuthu Vijayaragunatha Sethupathy and Queen Sakandhimuthal, she was brought up with the privileges and responsibilities of royalty. From a young age, Velu was trained rigorously in martial arts, including archery, sword fighting, and horse riding—skills rarely taught to girls at that time. Alongside physical training, she was educated in multiple languages such as Tamil, French, English, and Urdu, making her well-versed in communication and diplomacy. Her upbringing combined traditional royal education with warrior skills, preparing her for future leadership. This rare blend of education equipped her to not only govern but also to fight for her kingdom, a necessity she would face later. Velu Nachiyar’s early years were marked by discipline, courage, and an early exposure to the political environment of South India, setting the foundation for her role as a warrior queen. Her royal lineage and upbringing would be crucial in rallying support when she later challenged the British East India Company.</p>
