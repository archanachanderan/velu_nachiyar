      <h1 class="display">Exile and Strategic Alliances</h1>
      <p class="display2">After fleeing Sivagangai due to the British attack, Velu Nachiyar took refuge in the nearby fort town of Dindigul. This period of exile was critical for her political and military planning. She realized that confronting the British alone was impossible and sought alliances with powerful rulers who shared her goal of resisting colonialism. One of her most important allies was Hyder Ali, the Sultan of Mysore, who was himself engaged in a prolonged struggle against the British. Hyder Ali provided Velu with arms, training, and strategic counsel, significantly enhancing her military capabilities. In addition, she allied with the Marudu brothers, local chieftains known for their fierce opposition to British expansion. These alliances helped Velu Nachiyar gather a well-trained, diverse army that included men and women fighters united by the cause of liberating Sivagangai. Her exile was thus not a time of inactivity but of careful alliance-building, resource mobilization, and strategic preparation. This period laid the groundwork for her eventual military campaigns to reclaim her kingdom and resist British rule effectively.</p>
