      <p class="display2">Velu Nachiyar’s legacy as a fearless warrior queen and early freedom fighter is widely celebrated in India, especially in Tamil Nadu. She is regarded as one of the first Indian women to lead an armed resistance against British colonial rule. Her story inspires pride in female leadership and courage in the face of adversity. In 2008, the Government of India honored her by issuing a commemorative postage stamp. January 3, her birthday, is observed in Tamil Nadu as a day to remember her bravery and contributions. Schools, historians, and cultural organizations continue to celebrate her life and teachings. Velu Nachiyar’s example challenges traditional gender roles and highlights the significant role women played in India’s freedom movement. Her legacy lives on in popular culture, education, and public memory, symbolizing resistance, empowerment, and patriotism.</p>
