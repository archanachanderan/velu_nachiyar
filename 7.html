      <p class="display2">Following her successful reclaiming of Sivagangai, Velu Nachiyar focused on stabilizing her kingdom and implementing reforms. She was a just ruler who emphasized fairness, equality, and inclusive governance. Her administration promoted social harmony by ensuring representation of various castes and communities in decision-making. Velu appointed her daughter, Vellachi Nachiyar, as her heir to secure a smooth transition of power and continuity of governance. She also entrusted trusted allies like the Marudu brothers with significant administrative and military responsibilities. Velu encouraged education and cultural activities, aiming to revive local traditions and strengthen community identity. Her governance blended military strength with social progress, reflecting her holistic vision for Sivagangaiâ€™s future. She balanced the demands of security with the need for social welfare, making her reign a period of relative stability and growth despite ongoing colonial pressures.</p>
