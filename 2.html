      <h1 class="display">Marriage and Ascension</h1>
      <p class="display2">Velu Nachiyar married Muthu Vaduganatha Periyavudaya Thevar, the ruler of the Sivagangai kingdom, at the age of sixteen. The marriage united two important royal houses and marked the beginning of her role as a queen consort. For several years, she shared power and responsibilities with her husband, supporting him in governing the kingdom and maintaining peace. However, the political landscape of the time was volatile, with the British East India Company aggressively expanding its influence across India. In 1772, the British, allied with the Nawab of Arcot, launched a surprise attack on Sivagangai. The battle was fierce, and Veluâ€™s husband died fighting valiantly against the British forces. Following this devastating loss, Velu Nachiyar was forced to flee her kingdom to save her life and regroup for future resistance. Despite the personal tragedy, she quickly transformed from a grieving widow to a determined leader, vowing to reclaim her kingdom. Her ascension as a leader marked a significant turning point, making her one of the first Indian queens to openly oppose British colonialism.</p>
